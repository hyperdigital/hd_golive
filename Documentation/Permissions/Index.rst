Permissions
===========

There are two ways to allow checklist visibility:

1. Grant access to the "GO Live" module (module key: :php:`web_hdgolive`).
2. Enable the custom permission option:
   "GO Live checklist -> View checklist items".

If either is granted, the checklist items and page tree labels are visible.
If neither is granted, the module shows an info message and the page tree
labels are hidden.

After changing group permissions, users must log out and log in again.
